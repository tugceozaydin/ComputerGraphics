In the .html file, you will be seeing an armadillo and a virus next to it. W,S,A,D,E,Q keys can move the virus in 3 dimension. While the virus moves, the shading of the armadillo will change (the virus can be thought as a light source). When the virus is too close to the armadillo, the closest parts of the armadillo will turn green. You can also see the shading in the green according to how close the virus is. Closer the virus, brighter the color. 

Enjoy!
