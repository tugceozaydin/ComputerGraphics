In the .html file, you will be seeing an armadillo and a virus next to it. W,S,A,D,E,Q keys can move the virus in 3 dimension. While the virus moves, the shading of the armadillo will change (the virus can be thought as a light source). You can see different shadings when you click 1,2,3,4 and 5 keys. 1 refers to Phong Reflection, 2 refers to Blinn-Phong Reflection, 3 refers to Anitsotropic, 4 refers to Toon shading and 5 refers to seeing rolling stripes. You'll see how the shading differs according to the way you compute it!

Enjoy!
