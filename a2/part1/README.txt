In the .html file, you will be seeing an armadillo and a virus next to it. W,S,A,D,E,Q keys can move the virus in 3 dimension. 
While the virus moves, eyes of the armadillo will also follow the virus. 
When the virus reaches to a certain distance to armadillo, the eyes of the armadillo will shoot laser towards the virus.  
When the virus gets closer to the armadillo, armadillo will dodge away from the virus to not get touched by it.

Side note: Possible solution is commented out in the vertex shader for armadillo to dodge nicer in its pelvis but couldn't get the right result.
